# Generating README.md

For the convenience of organization and editing, we do documentation separately and harness them into a single ``README.md`` using ``markdown-pp``. This illustrates how to use ``markdown-pp``.

## Installing Pip

``markdown-pp`` can be installed through ``pip``. If ``pip`` is not installed on your local machine, it can be obtained as follows.

  0. Confirm that you have a version of python on your machine.
  1. Download ``get-pip.py`` from [here](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py).
  2. Run ``python get-pip.py``. Then, check its availability.
  ```
> which pip
pip is /Users/bob/Library/Python/2.7/bin/pip
  ```
  3. Using a Mac system, a user may need to run the following command.
  ```
> sudo python -m pip install -U pip==8.0.1
You are using pip version 7.1.0, however version 20.1 is available.
You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
