We provided instructions to perform a CSP analysis for a general ODE system and a detailed chemical kinetic ODE system in examples [gODE](#cspanalysisforthedavisskodjeproblemusingthegeneralodeclass) and [TChemODE](#cspanalysisforaodesystemusingtchem). These examples showed how to use the different CSPlib functions. We divided the CSP analysis into three blocks, the model block (see [api-model section](#modelclass)), the kernel block (see [api-kernel section](#kernelclass)), and the index block (see [api-index section](#indexclass)). For each block, we have implemented a class. Additionally, we have an interface for the Tines-GPU eigensolver (see [api-Eigen-Solver-With-Tines section](#eigensolverwithtines)). We describe the CSPlib functions in the application programming interface [section](#applicationprogramminginterface). We recommend using these examples as a template and add or delete parts to create an analysis that fits the userâ€™s demands.
